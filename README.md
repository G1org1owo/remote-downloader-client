This chrome extension allows hijacking of downloads so that every time a download would start on your machine, it is instead blocked and started on a remote server you can specify. The remote server must be running [G1org1owo/remote-downloader-server](https://github.com/G1org1owo/remote-downloader-server).

The communication is done through web sockets and the project was heavily vibecoded at the start, then I had to make several fixes by hand as it got way easier than trying to deal with GPT's hallucinations.
